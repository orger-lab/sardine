Sardine is an open-source framework for developing and executing complex scientific workflows written in C# and built with .NET 8.
It is designed to rapidly create and execute data acquisition and processing desktop applications following a modular approach. 

Sardine allows the reliable execution of dynamic networks of independent modules - where each module can interface with hardware, process data, or both.
It includes integrated logging and UI management, has a low overhead, provides fault-tolerant hardware control, and minimizes downstream delays by
providing dedicated data processing queues for each module. Any .NET class can be easily adapted to a Sardine module, facilitating integration with existing codebases.
